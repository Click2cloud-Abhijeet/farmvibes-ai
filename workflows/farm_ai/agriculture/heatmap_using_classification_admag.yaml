description:
  short_description: This workflow integrate the ADMAG API to download prescriptions and generate heatmap.
  long_description: The prescriptions are related with farm boundary and the nutrient information. Each prescription represent a sensor sample at a location within a farm boundary.

  sources:
    input_raster: Input raster for index computation.
    admag_input: Required inputs to download prescriptions from admag.
  sinks:
    result: Zip file containing cluster geometries.
  parameters:
    base_url: URL to access the registered app
    client_id:
      Value uniquely identifies registered application in the Microsoft identity platform. Visit url
      https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app to register the app.
    client_secret:
      Sometimes called an application password, a client secret is a string value your app can use in place of a certificate
      to identity itself.
    authority:
      The endpoint URIs for your app are generated automatically when you register or configure your app. It is used by
      client to obtain authorization from the resource owner
    default_scope: URL for default azure OAuth2 permissions
