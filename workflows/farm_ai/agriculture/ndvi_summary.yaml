description:
  short_description:
    Calculates NDVI statistics (mean, standard deviation, maximum and minimum) for the input
    geometry and time range.
  long_description:
    The workflow retrieves the relevant Sentinel-2 products with Planetary Computer (PC) API,
    forwards them to a cloud detection model and combines the predicted cloud mask to the mask
    obtained from the product. The workflow computes the NDVI for each available tile and date,
    summarizing each with the mean, standard deviation, maximum and minimum values for the regions
    not obscured by clouds. Finally, it outputs a timeseries with such statistics for all available
    dates, ignoring heavily-clouded tiles.
  sources:
    user_input: Time range and geometry of interest.
  sinks:
    timeseries:
      Aggregated NDVI statistics of the retrieved tiles within the input geometry and time range.
  parameters:
    pc_key: Optional Planetary Computer API key.
