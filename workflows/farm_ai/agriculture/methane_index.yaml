  short_description: Computes methane index from ultra emitters for a region and date range.
  long_description:
    The workflow retrieves the relevant Sentinel-2 products with Planetary Computer (PC) API and
    crop the rasters for the region defined in user_input. All bands are normalized and an
    anti-aliasing guassian filter is applied to smooth and remove potential artifacts. An
    unsupervised K-Nearest Neighbor is applied to identify bands similar to band 12, and the index
    is computed by the difference between band 12 to the pixel-wise median of top K similar bands.
  sources:
    user_input: Time range and geometry of interest.
  sinks:
    index: Methane index raster.
    s2_raster: Sentinel-2 raster.
    cloud_mask: Cloud mask.
  parameters:
    pc_key: Optional Planetary Computer API key.
