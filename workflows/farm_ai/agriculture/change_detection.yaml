description:
  short_description: Identifies changes/outliers over NDVI across dates.
  long_description:
    The workflow generates SpaceEye imagery for the input region and time range and computes NDVI
    raster for each date. It aggregates NDVI statistics (mean, standard deviation, maximum and
    minimum) in time and detects outliers across dates with a single-component Gaussian Mixture
    Model (GMM).
  sources:
    user_input: Time range and geometry of interest.
  sinks:
    spaceeye_raster: SpaceEye cloud-free rasters.
    index: NDVI rasters.
    timeseries: Aggregated NDVI statistics over the time range.
    segmentation:
      Segmentation maps based on the likelihood of each sample belonging to the GMM's
      single-component.
    heatmap: Likelihood maps.
    outliers: Outlier maps.
    mixture_means: Means of the GMM.
  parameters:
    pc_key: PlanetaryComputer API key.
