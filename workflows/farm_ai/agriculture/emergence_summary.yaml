description:
  short_description:
    Calculates emergence statistics using thresholded MSAVI (mean, standard deviation, maximum and
    minimum) for the input geometry and time range.
  long_description:
    The workflow retrieves Sentinel2 products with Planetary Computer (PC) API, forwards them to a
    cloud detection model and combines the predicted cloud mask to the mask provided by PC. It
    computes the MSAVI for each available tile and date, thresholds them above a certain value and
    summarizes each with the mean, standard deviation, maximum and minimum values for the regions
    not obscured by clouds. Finally, it outputs a timeseries with such statistics for all available
    dates, filtering out heavily-clouded tiles.
  sources:
    user_input: Time range and geometry of interest.
  sinks:
    timeseries:
      Aggregated emergence statistics of the retrieved tiles within the input geometry and time
      range.
  parameters:
    pc_key: Optional Planetary Computer API key.
