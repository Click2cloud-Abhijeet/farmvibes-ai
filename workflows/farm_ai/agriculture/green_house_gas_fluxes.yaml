  short_description: Computes Green House Fluxes for a region and date range
  long_description: >-
    The workflow follows the GHG Protocol guidelines published for Brazil
    (which are based on IPCC reports) to compute Green House Gas emission
    fluxes (sequestration versus emissions) for a given crop.
  sources:
    user_input: The user-provided inputs for GHG computation.
  sinks:
    fluxes: The computed fluxes for the given area and date range considering the user input data.
  parameters:
    crop_type: >-
      The type of the crop to compute GHG emissions.
      Supported crops are 'wheat', 'corn', 'cotton', and 'soybeans'.
