  short_description: Identify optimal locations by performing clustering operation using Gaussian Mixture model on computed raster indices.
  long_description: |-
    The clustering operation separate computed raster indices values into n groups of equal variance, each group assigned a location and that location is considered as a
    optimal locations. The sample locations generated provide information of latitude and longitude. The optimal location can be utilized to install sensors and collect
    soil information. The index parameter used as input to run the computed index workflow internally using the input raster submitted. The selection of index parameter varies
    based on requirement. The workflow supports all the indices supported by spyndex library (https://github.com/awesome-spectral-indices/awesome-spectral-indices#vegetation).
    Below provided various indices that are used to identify optimal locations and generated a nutrients heatmap.
    Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) - EVI is designed to minimize the influence of soil brightness and atmospheric conditions on vegetation assessment. It is calculated
    using the red, blue, and near-infrared (NIR) bands. EVI is particularly useful for monitoring vegetation in regions with high canopy cover and in areas where atmospheric
    interference is significant. This indices also used in notebook (notebooks/heatmaps/nutrients_using_neighbors.ipynb) that derive nutrient information for Carbon, Nitrogen,
    and Phosphorus.
    Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) - It is a vegetation index used to assess the light-use efficiency of plants in terms of photosynthesis and their response to
    changes in light conditions, particularly variations in the blue and red parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. This index also used in notebook
    (notebooks/heatmaps/nutrients_using_neighbors.ipynb) that derive nutrient information for pH.
    The number of sample locations generated depend on input parameters submitted. Tune n_clusters and sieve_size parameters to generate more or less location data points.
    For a 100 acre farm, 
    - 20 sample locations are generated using n_clusters=5 and sieve_size=10.
    - 30 sample locations are generated using n_clusters=5 and sieve_size=20.
    - 80 sample locations are generated using n_clusters=5 and sieve_size=5.
    - 130 sample locations are generated using n_clusters=8 and sieve_size=5.
