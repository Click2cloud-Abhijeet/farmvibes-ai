description:
  short_description:
    Runs a crop segmentation model based on NDVI from SpaceEye imagery along the year.
  long_description:
    The workflow generates SpaceEye cloud-free data for the input region and time range and computes
    NDVI over those. NDVI values sampled regularly along the year are stacked as bands and used as
    input to the crop segmentation model.
  sources:
    user_input: Time range and geometry of interest.
  sinks:
    segmentation: Crop segmentation map at 10m resolution.
  parameters:
    pc_key: Optional Planetary Computer API key.
    model_file: Path to the ONNX file containing the model architecture and weights.
    model_bands: Number of NDVI bands to stack as the model input.
