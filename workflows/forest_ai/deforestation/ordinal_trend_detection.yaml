  short_description: 
    Detects increase/decrease trends in the pixel levels over the user-input geometry and time range.
  long_description:
    This workflow prepares rasters to perform the Cochran-Armitage trend test
    over a user-provided geometry and time range. Initially, it recodes the
    input raster according to the 'from_values' and 'to_values' parameters. For
    example, if the original raster has values (2, 1, 3, 4, 5) and the default
    values of 'from_values' and 'to_values' are respectively [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and
    [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], the recoded raster will have values (7, 6, 8, 9, 10).  The
    workflow then clips the user-provided geometries and computes an ordinal
    raster. It also counts each unique pixel present in the recoded rasters to
    create a pixel frequency contingency table. This data is used to determine
    if there is an increasing or decreasing trend in pixel levels.  The
    Cochran-Armitage test is a non-parametric test used to ascertain this trend.
    The null hypothesis assumes no trend in pixel levels, while the alternative
    hypothesis assumes a trend exists. The test returns a p-value and a z-score.
    If the p-value is less than some significance level, the null hypothesis is
    rejected in favor of the alternative. A positive z-score indicates an
    increasing trend, while a negative one indicates a decreasing trend.
