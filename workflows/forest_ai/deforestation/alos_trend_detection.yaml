  short_description: 
    Detects increase/decrease trends in forest pixel levels over the user-input geometry and time range for the ALOS forest map. 
  long_description:
    This workflow combines the alos_forest_extent_download_merge and
    ordinal_trend_detection workflows to detect increase/decrease trends in the
    forest pixel levels over the user-provided geometry and time range for the
    ALOS forest map. The ALOS PALSAR 2.1 Forest/Non-Forest Maps are downloaded
    in the alos_forest_extent_download_merge workflow.  Then the
    ordinal_trend_detection workflow clips the ordinal raster to the
    user-provided geometry and time range and determines if there is an
    increasing or decreasing trend in the forest pixel levels over them.
    alos_trend_detection uses the Cochran-Armitage test to detect trends in the
    forest levels over the years.  The null hypothesis is that there is no trend
    in the pixel levels over the list of rasters. The alternative hypothesis is
    that there is a trend in the forest pixel levels over the list of rasters
    (one for each year). It returns a p-value and a z-score. If the p-value is
    less than some significance level, the null hypothesis is rejected and the
    alternative hypothesis is accepted. If the z-score is positive, the trend is
    increasing.  If the z-score is negative, the trend is decreasing.
