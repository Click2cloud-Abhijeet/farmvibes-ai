description:
  short_description: Performs a clip on an input raster based on a provided reference geometry.
  long_description:
    The workflow outputs a new raster copied from the input raster with its geometry metadata as the
    intersection between the input raster's geometry and the provided reference geometry. If the 
    parameter hard_clip is set to true, then only data in the intersection is kept in output. The
    workflow raises an error if there is no intersection between both geometries.
  sources:
    raster: Input raster to be clipped.
    input_geometry: Reference geometry.
  sinks:
    clipped_raster: Clipped raster with the reference geometry.
  parameters:
    hard_clip: >
       if true, keeps only data inside the intersection of reference and input geometries, soft clip
       otherwise
