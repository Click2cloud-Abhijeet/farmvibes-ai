description:
  short_description: Resamples input rasters to the reference rasters' grid.
  long_description:
    The workflow will produce input and reference raster pairs with intersecting geometries. For
    each pair, the input raster is resampled to match the reference raster's grid. Afterwards, all
    resampled rasters are groupped if they are contained in a reference raster geometry, and each
    raster group is matched into single raster. The output should contain the information available
    in the input rasters, gridded according to the reference rasters.
  sources:
    rasters: Input rasters that will be resampled.
    ref_rasters: Reference rasters.
  sinks:
    match_rasters: Rasters with information from the input rasters on the reference grid.
  parameters:
    resampling: >-
