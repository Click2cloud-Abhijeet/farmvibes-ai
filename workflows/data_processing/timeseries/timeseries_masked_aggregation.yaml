description:
  short_description:
    Computes the mean, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum values of all regions of the raster
    considered by the mask and aggregates them into a timeseries.
  long_description:
  sources:
    raster: Input raster.
    mask: Mask of the regions to be considered during summarization;
    input_geometry: Geometry of interest.
  sinks:
    timeseries: Aggregated statistics of the raster considered by the mask.
  parameters:
    timeseries_masked_thr:
      Threshold of the maximum ratio of masked content allowed in a raster. The statistics of
      rasters with masked content above the threshold (e.g., heavily clouded) are not included in
      the timeseries.
