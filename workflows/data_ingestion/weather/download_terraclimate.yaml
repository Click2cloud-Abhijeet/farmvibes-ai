description:
  short_description: Monthly climate and hydroclimate properties from TerraClimate.
  long_description: >-
    The workflow downloads weather and hydrological data for the input time range.  Data is
    available for global terrestrial surfaces from 1958-present, with a monthly  temporal resolution
    and a ~4-km (1/24th degree) spatial resolution.

    user_input: Time range of interest.

    downloaded_product: Downloaded variable for each year in the input time range.

      Options are:
        aet - Actual Evapotranspiration (monthly total, units = mm)
        def - Climate Water Deficit (monthly total, units = mm)
        pet - Potential evapotranspiration (monthly total, units = mm)
        ppt - Precipitation (monthly total, units = mm)
        q - Runoff (monthly total, units = mm)
        soil - Soil Moisture (total column at end of month, units = mm)
        srad - Downward surface shortwave radiation (units = W/m2)
        swe - Snow water equivalent (at end of month, units = mm)
        tmax - Max Temperature (average for month, units = C)
        tmin - Min Temperature (average for month, units = C)
        vap - Vapor pressure (average for month, units = kPa)
        ws - Wind speed (average for month, units = m/s)
        vpd - Vapor Pressure Deficit (average for month, units = kPa)
        PDSI - Palmer Drought Severity Index (at end of month, units = unitless)
