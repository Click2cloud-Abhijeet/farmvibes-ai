  short_description: Daily surface meteorological properties from GridMET.
  long_description: >-
    The workflow downloads weather and hydrological data for the input time range.  Data is
    available for the contiguous US and southern British Columbia surfaces from 1979-present, with a
    daily temporal resolution and a ~4-km (1/24th degree) spatial resolution.
  sources:
    user_input: Time range of interest.
  sinks:
    downloaded_product: Downloaded variable for each year in the input time range.
  parameters:
    variable: >-
      Options are:
        bi - Burning Index
        erc - Energy Release Component
        etr - Daily reference evapotranspiration (alfafa, units = mm)
        fm100 - Fuel Moisture (100-hr, units = %)
        fm1000 - Fuel Moisture (1000-hr, units = %)
        pet - Potential evapotranspiration (reference grass evapotranspiration, units = mm)
        pr - Precipitation amount (daily total, units = mm)
        rmax - Maximum relative humidity (units = %)
        rmin - Minimum relative humidity (units = %)
        sph - Specific humididy (units = kg/kg)
        srad - Downward surface shortwave radiation (units = W/m^2)
        th - Wind direction (degrees clockwise from North)
        tmmn - Minimum temperature (units = K)
        tmmx - Maximum temperature (units = K)
        vpd - Vapor Pressure Deficit (units = kPa)
        vs - Wind speed at 10m (units = m/s)
