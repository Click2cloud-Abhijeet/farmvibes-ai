  short_description: 
    Downloads Bing Maps basemap tiles and merges them into a single raster. 
  long_description:
    The workflow will list all tiles intersecting with the input geometry for a given zoom level, 
    and download a basemap for each of them using Bing Maps API. The basemaps will be merged into
    a single raster with the union of the geometries of all tiles.

    input_geometry: Geometry of interest for which to download the basemap tiles.
  sinks:
    merged_basemap: Merged basemap raster.
