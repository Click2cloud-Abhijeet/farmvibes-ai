  short_description:
    Improves cloud masks by merging the product cloud mask with cloud and shadow masks computed by
    machine learning segmentation models.
  long_description:
    This workflow computes cloud and shadow probabilities using segmentation models, thresholds
    them, and merges the models' masks with the product mask.
  sources:
    s2_raster: Sentinel-2 L2A raster.
    product_mask: Cloud mask obtained from the product's quality indicators.
  sinks:
    mask: Improved cloud mask.
  parameters:
    cloud_thr: Confidence threshold to assign a pixel as cloud.
    shadow_thr: Confidence threshold to assign a pixel as shadow.
    in_memory:
      Whether to load the whole raster in memory when running predictions. Uses more memory
      (~4GB/worker) but speeds up inference for fast models.
    cloud_model:
      ONNX file for the cloud model. Available models are 'cloud_model{idx}_cpu.onnx' with idx ∈ {1,
      2} being FPN-based models, which are more accurate but slower, and idx ∈ {3, 4, 5} being
      cheaplab models, which are less accurate but faster.
    shadow_model:
      ONNX file for the shadow model. 'shadow.onnx' is the only currently available model.
