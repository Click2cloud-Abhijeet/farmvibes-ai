description:
  short_description:
    Improves cloud masks by merging the product cloud mask with cloud and shadow masks computed by
    an ensemble of machine learning segmentation models.
  long_description:
    This workflow computes cloud and shadow probabilities using and ensemble of segmentation models,
    thresholds them, and merges the models' masks with the product mask.
  sources:
    s2_raster: Sentinel-2 L2A raster.
    product_mask: Cloud mask obtained from the product's quality indicators.
  sinks:
    mask: Improved cloud mask.
  parameters:
    cloud_thr: Confidence threshold to assign a pixel as cloud.
    shadow_thr: Confidence threshold to assign a pixel as shadow.
