  short_description:
    Downloads and preprocesses Sentinel-2 imagery that covers the input geometry and time range, and
    computes improved cloud masks using an ensemble of cloud and shadow segmentation models.
  long_description:
    This workflow selects a minimum set of tiles that covers the input geometry, downloads
    Sentinel-2 imagery for the selected time range, and preprocesses it by generating a single
    multi-band raster at 10m resolution. It then improves cloud masks by merging the product mask
    with cloud and shadow masks computed using an ensemble of cloud and shadow segmentation models.
  sources:
    user_input: Time range and geometry of interest.
  sinks:
    raster: Sentinel-2 L2A rasters with all bands resampled to 10m resolution.
    mask: Cloud masks at 10m resolution.
