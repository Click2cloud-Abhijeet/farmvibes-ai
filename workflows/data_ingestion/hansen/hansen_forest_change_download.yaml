description:
  short_description: Downloads and merges Global Forest Change (Hansen) rasters that intersect the user-provided geometry/time range.
  long_description: 
    The workflow lists Global Forest Change (Hansen) products that intersect the
    user-provided geometry/time range, downloads the data for each of them, and
    merges the rasters. The dataset is available at 30m resolution and is
    updated annually. The data contains information on forest cover, loss, and
    gain. The default dataset version is GFC-2022-v1.10 and is passed to the
    workflow as the parameter tiles_folder_url. For the default version, the
    dataset is available from 2000 to 2022.  Dataset details can be found at
    https://storage.googleapis.com/earthenginepartners-hansen/GFC-2022-v1.10/download.html.
  sources:
    input_item: User-provided geometry and time range.
  sinks:
    merged_raster: Merged Global Forest Change (Hansen) data as a raster.
    downloaded_raster: Individual Global Forest Change (Hansen) rasters prior to the merge operation.
  parameters:
    tiles_folder_url: 
      URL to the Global Forest Change (Hansen) dataset. It specifies the dataset
      version and is used to download the data.  
    layer_name:
      Name of the Global Forest Change (Hansen) layer. Can be any of the following names
      'treecover2000', 'loss', 'gain', 'lossyear', 'datamask', 'first', 'last'.
