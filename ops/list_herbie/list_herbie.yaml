    product:
      Output variable product file type (sfc (surface fields), prs (pressure fields), nat (native fields),
      subh (subhourly fields)). Not specifying this will use the first product in model template file.
    frequency: frequency in hours of the forecast
    forecast_lead_times:
      Forecast lead time in the format [start_time, end_time, increment] (in hours). If this parameter is
      None, then this op lists analysis (zero lead time) up to the latest analysis available, and from
      that point it lists forecasts with progressively increasing lead times.
    forecast_start_date:
      latest datetime (in the format "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M") for which analysis (zero lead time) are listed.
      After this datetime, this op lists forecasts with progressively increasing lead times. This parameter
      must be set to None if 'forecast_lead_times' is used.
    search_text:
      It's a regular expression used to search on GRIB2 Index files and allow you to download just the layer
      of the file required instead of complete file.
