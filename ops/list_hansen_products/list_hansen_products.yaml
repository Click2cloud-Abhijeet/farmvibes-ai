description:
  short_description: Lists Global Forest Change (Hansen) products that intersect the user-provided geometry/time range.
  long_description: 
    The op will list Global Forest Change (Hansen) products that intersect the
    user-provided geometry/time range.  The dataset is available at 30m
    resolution and is updated annually. The data contains information on forest
    cover, loss, and gain. Full dataset details can be found at
    https://storage.googleapis.com/earthenginepartners-hansen/GFC-2022-v1.10/download.html.
  sources:
    input_item: User-provided geometry and time range.
  sinks:
    hansen_products: List of Global Forest Change (Hansen) products that intersect the user-provided geometry/time range.
  parameters:
    tiles_folder_url: 
      URL to the Global Forest Change (Hansen) dataset. It specifies the dataset
      version and is used to download the data. The default value is
      https://storage.googleapis.com/earthenginepartners-hansen/GFC-2022-v1.10/ 
      with the dataset version GFC-2022-v1.10.
    layer_name:
      Name of the Global Forest Change (Hansen) layer. Can be any of the following names
      'treecover2000', 'loss', 'gain', 'lossyear', 'datamask', 'first', 'last'.
    tile_geometry:
      Path to the GeoJSON file containing the tile geometries. It is used to filter
      the tiles that intersect the user-provided geometry/time range. As the Hansen dataset
      uses the same tiling system as the GLAD dataset, the default value is the GLAD tile geometry.
