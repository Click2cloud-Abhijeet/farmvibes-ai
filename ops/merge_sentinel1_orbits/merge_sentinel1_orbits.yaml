description:
  short_description:
    Merge items from the same absolute orbit into the appropriate MGRS (Sentinel-2 tiling system)
    tile.
  long_description:
    The op will merge the items by reprojecting the data, if necessary, to the appropriate CRS and
    then merging them using the order of the assets in the input as priority.
  inputs:
    raster_group: Rasters from the same orbit that will be merged.
  output:
    merged: Raster containing merged data.
  parameters:
    resampling:
      How to resample the input data. See
      https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/rasterio.enums.html#rasterio.enums.Resampling
      for more information on available sampling methods.
