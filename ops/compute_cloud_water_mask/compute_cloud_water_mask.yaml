description:
  short_description: Merges landsat cloud mask and NDVI-based mask to produce a cloud water mask.
  long_description: NDVI index with less than or equal to 0 values are used to identify water bodies, and qa_pixel band 
    is used to identify cloudy areas. Both of these are masked out. The clould_water_mask has a value of 1 or 0 per pixel;
    1 meaning the pixel is free of clouds and water bodies, and 0 meaning the pixel is contaminated with either cloud or 
    waterbodies, or both.
  parameters:
    ndvi_threshold: NDVI threshold for excluding water bodies
      (everything under this threshold is assumed to be water).
