  short_description: Merges rasters in a sequence to a single raster.
  parameters:
    resampling:
      Resampling method used to reproject the rasters to a common CRS.
    resolution: >-
      Determines how the resolution of the output raster is defined. One of 'equal' (breaks if the
      resolution of the sequence rasters are not the same), 'lowest' (uses the lowest resolution
      among rasters), 'highest' (uses the highest resolution among rasters), or 'average' (averages
      the resolution of all rasters in the sequence).
