  short_description: Detects increase/decrease trends over a list of Rasters.
  long_description: 
    Performs a cochran-armitage trend test over a list of rasters. The test
    determines if there is an increasing/decreasing trend in the pixel levels
    over the list of rasters. For instance, if the ordinal raster represents the
    presence of forest in a given area (e.g., 0 - Non-forest, 1- Forest, 2-
    Dense Forest), the test will determine if the forest is increasing or
    decreasing over the sequence of rasters. The null hypothesis is that there
    is no trend in the pixel levels over the list of rasters. The alternative
    hypothesis is that there is a trend in the pixel levels over the list of
    rasters. The test returns a p-value and a z-score.  If the p-value is less
    than some significance level, the null hypothesis is rejected and the
    alternative hypothesis is accepted.  If the z-score is positive, the trend
    is increasing. If the z-score is negative, the trend is decreasing.
