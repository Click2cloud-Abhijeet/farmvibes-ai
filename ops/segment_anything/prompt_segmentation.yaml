description:
  short_description: Runs SAM over the input raster with points and bounding boxes as prompts.
  parameters:
    model_type: SAM's image encoder backbone architecture, among 'vit_h', 'vit_l', or 'vit_b'. Before running the workflow, make sure the desired model has been exported to the cluster by running `scripts/export_sam_models.py`. For more information, refer to the FarmVibes.AI troubleshooting page in the documentation.
    band_names: Name of raster bands that should be selected to compose the 3-channel images expected by SAM. If not provided, will try to use ["R", "G", "B"]. If only a single band name is provided, will replicate it through all three channels.
    band_scaling: A list of floats to scale each band by to the range of [0.0, 1.0] or [0.0, 255.0]. If not provided, will default to the raster scaling parameter. If a list with a single value is provided, will use it for all three bands.
    band_offset: A list of floats to offset each band by. If not provided, will default to the raster offset value. If a list with a single value is provided, will use it for all three bands.
    spatial_overlap: Percentage of spatial overlap between chips in the range of [0.0, 1.0).
    points_per_batch: Number of points to process in a single batch.
    num_workers: Number of workers to use for parallel processing.
    in_memory: Whether to load the whole raster in memory when running predictions. Uses more memory (~4GB/worker) but speeds up inference for fast models.
