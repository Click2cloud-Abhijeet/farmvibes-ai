  long_description:
    The op will read the bands from the Planetary Computer, resample them to 10m resolution, and
    stack them into a single 12-band TIFF file. A cloud mask obtained from quality indicators is
    also generated at 10m resolution.
  inputs:
    sentinel_product: Product to be downloaded.
  output:
    raster:
