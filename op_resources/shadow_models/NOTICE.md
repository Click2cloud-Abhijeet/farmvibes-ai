# NOTICE

The model in this directory represents a fully convolutional model for
producing segmentation maps of cloud shadows in Sentinel-2 L2A imagery.

The L2A cloud shadow dataset was built by merging annotations from two cloud mask datasets that also
included cloud shadow annotations: 
 - [Sentinel-2 Cloud Mask Catalogue](https://zenodo.org/record/4172871) and
 - [Sentinel-2 KappaZeta Cloud and Cloud Shadow Masks](https://zenodo.org/record/5095024)
